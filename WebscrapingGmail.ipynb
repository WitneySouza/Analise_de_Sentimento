Ori : I using this app to differentiate my personal and work email with the other outlook app. But it always adding new line at the end of my email all the time, and the views went all over the place during reply.

Not having a week or month view as an option is inexcusable. I also don't see a way to view a shared calendar. I end up having to use OWA to view my calendars. I know this is a \"lite\" version of an app, but as far as I'm concerned, having a functional calendar is a key component of Outlook. If this was fixed, it would be an easy 5 stars.\n",
